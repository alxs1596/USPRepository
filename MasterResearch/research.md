Studing the way 

Create an Hidrogen

Can be used in agriculture

Energy

Hidrogen can be use as

Inv. the features of the bubbles when it is in touch with the eletrode

How many bubbles are produced

Behavior shape

Videos or sequences of images, 

Use Frames will be better

There is a time that the bubble is desconnected from the electrode

- brackground in subtraction in two images

## Two main goals  
- The bubble while is connected to the electrode
- The bubble better goes to the surface


- The trajectory
- big bubbles slow
- other fast
- 

Start subtracting two images
 each frame of the video


- leveling of objects in movement
-
